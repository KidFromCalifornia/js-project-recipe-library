The Recipe Library is a responsive web application that allows users to discover and explore a variety of recipes from different cuisines using the Spoonacular API. Users can filter recipes by cuisine, sort them by servings, popularity, or cooking time, and search for specific recipes by title, cuisine, or diet. The application also features a random recipe generator for users who need inspiration. It is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
